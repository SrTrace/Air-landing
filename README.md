# Air Agency - Landing Page

This project implements a landing page based on a [Figma design](<https://www.figma.com/file/7qwsWggv9BAxMi2VPhBuPr/Air-(formerly-Dia)?node-id=9138%3A35>), utilizing BEM and SCSS methodologies.

## Project Goals

The main objectives of this project are:

- To practice and understand the use of BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology.
- To implement SCSS (Sassy CSS) for efficient and modular styling, using mixins, extends, nesting, variables, and style blocking on blocks.
- To create a responsive web page that adapts seamlessly across various screen sizes.

## Responsive Design

The landing page is designed to adapt to the following screen sizes:

- **Large screens**: 2560px
- **Design width**: 1600px
- **Desktop**: 1280px
- **Small desktop**: 1024px
- **Tablet**: 640px
- **Mobile**: > 320px

## Benefits of BEM

Using BEM (Block Element Modifier) provides several benefits for building scalable and maintainable web pages:

- **Scalability**: Allows easy expansion and scaling of the project.
- **Reusability**: Components can be reused across different parts of the project.
- **Maintainability**: Simplifies updating and maintaining the codebase with a clear naming convention.
- **Readability**: Makes the project structure easier to understand, beneficial for new developers.

## SCSS Features

In this project, SCSS has been used to enhance the styling process with the following features:

- **Mixins**: For reusable chunks of CSS.
- **Extends**: To share a set of CSS properties from one selector to another.
- **Nesting**: To nest your CSS selectors in a way that follows the same visual hierarchy of your HTML.
- **Variables**: To store values that you reuse throughout your CSS.
- **Style Blocking**: To keep styles organized and specific to blocks.
